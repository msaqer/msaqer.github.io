                <!-- Research Statement -->
                <h3>Research Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    My research in computer science centers on harnessing advanced natural language processing, cybersecurity, and machine learning techniques to devise practical solutions for emerging digital threats. During my Ph.D. Study at North Dakota State University, I have developed a Cybersecurity NLP Identifier and Grader that automatically analyzes and classifies social media content related to cybersecurity incidents. This project aims to enhance cyber threat intelligence by pinpointing the most important and relevant security issues. It also exemplifies my commitment to translating theoretical insights into impactful, real-world applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My scholarly contributions include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implementing automated methodologies to categorize large volumes of cybersecurity news, thereby streamlining the dissemination of critical security information.</li>
                    <li>Analyzing public sentiments during major global events using deep learning techniques.</li>
                    <li>Applying state-of-the-art NLP models (such as GPT, BERT, and RoBERTa) for robust offensive language detection.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Looking ahead, I plan to develop domain-specific large language models tailored for cybersecurity and integrate ethical, privacy-preserving strategies into AI systems. These initiatives, combined with my proven ability to secure research funding and mentor emerging scholars, ensure that my work not only advances academic understanding but also drives practical improvements in cybersecurity.
